# Windows-10-Exploit
THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!

A set of programs that can allow one to take control of any Windows 7 or Windows 10 based computer.
Utilizes a well known exploit that has existed since Windows Vista.

Usage is simple; get into the startup repair, then once it gives you an option to bring up a command prompt, do so. Next, download the built executeable from git hub via bitsadmin or powershell command (tutorial comming soon!).
Once the program is downloaded, run it. What it will do is it will.. explain what the script does.
