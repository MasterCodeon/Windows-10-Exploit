Program outline: Execute a bitsadmin file download to download the program. The syntax for the command can be found at the first link.
Next, execute the downloaded program.

Program execution layout:
1. Determine which drive is the main windows drive (not the WinPE drive). Assumes that there is only one windows installation on the PC and that no mutli-booting exists.
In theory, it could be set to detect mutiple instances of windows accross different drives and ask which one to exploit.
	Do this by checking on each drive is the file C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe exists.

2. If osk.exe exists, rename it to osk.exe.old.
3. Make a copy of cmd.exe and rename it to osk.exe

4. Optional - Instead of copying cmd over osk, write an embedded program that will automaticaly enable the butilt in admin account with a specfic password, or add a new account with a specfic password.
Note: Both ways can setup the admin account to have no password.
